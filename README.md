# Computer-Networks


## Description
This repository is dedicated to the study of Computer Networks. It provides a comprehensive overview of networking concepts, protocols, and architectures. In addition to theoretical knowledge, I will implement projects using Socket Programming in Python to demonstrate practical applications of networking concepts.

## Contents
- **Introduction to Computer Networks**: An overview of networking fundamentals, including types of networks (LAN, WAN, MAN) and the OSI model.
- **Networking Protocols**: In-depth explanations of key protocols such as TCP/IP, HTTP, FTP, and DNS, along with their functionalities and use cases.
- **Network Architecture**: Discussion on different network architectures including client-server and peer-to-peer models.
- **Socket Programming Projects**: Practical implementations of socket programming using Python to illustrate networking concepts in real-world scenarios.
- **Network Security**: An introduction to essential network security practices, threats, and mitigation strategies.
